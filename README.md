# mantinone.github.io
Max Antinone's Personal Portfolio Website

The site is currently accessibly through a test-domain at http://doomedtowander.nfshost.com/
(It should be www.mantinone.com after I do some webspace juggling)

## Specifications

- [x] Site is hosted (I recommend Heroku or gh-pages)
- [x] Site prominently features link to your GitHub
- [x] Site uses a CSS framework
- [x] Site includes blurbs / screenshots / links (both to GitHub and live site) to your most impressive projects (at least 2)
- [x] Site includes blurbs / links to your open source contributions

### Optional / Nice to haves

- [ ] Site includes Twitter integration (tweets show up on site)
- [ ] Site includes a blog or a link to your blog
- [x] Uses a custom domain (I recommend using [Google Domains](https://domains.google/)) - this will cost you a little $$
